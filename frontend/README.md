# Culdevate Frontend

## How to Get Started

Install all dependencies with `npm ci`.

Start up the Webpack dev server by doing `npm run dev`. Go to `http://localhost:8080` to
see your code changes.

### Storybook Driven Development

When we locally develop, we commonly design and create components in isolation with Storybook.

Do `npm run storybook` and go to `http://localhost:9001/` to check out all the stories.

## Building Production Assets

Build out the production assets by doing `npm run build` and see the outputs in the `dist` folder.
